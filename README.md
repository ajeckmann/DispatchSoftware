Video Explanation of this project coming soon!

Until then, here's a description:

My goal was to create a small-scale dispatching system that could be used by a 911 center to track calls, the units responding to those calls, and the personnel staffing those units. My interest in CAD (computer aided dispatch) was sparked around 10 years ago during my time as a volunteer EMT in Montgomery County, Maryland. After being on the receiving end of dispatches sent from the 911 center, I became interested in exactly what went on behind the scenes there. Thankfully, I had the opportunity to visit the 911 communications center and was extremely impressed by the multitude of personnel utilizing sophisticated software to track and manage emergencies county-wide.

I determined the needs of this application from my own experience with real dispatching software--namely: 
1: The need to store create an incident object in a database and store its information

2: The need to determine the appropriate rescue vehicle to dispatch to the incident

3: The need to track that unit over the course of its response

4: The need to ensure staffing needs of each apparatus met by appropriate personnel (i.e. ensure only paramedics ride medic units, Firefighter Level II rides rescue squad, etc...)
